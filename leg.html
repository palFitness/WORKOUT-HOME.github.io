              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Set a barbell on a power rack at about shoulder height. Grab the power with an overhand grip at shoulder width and raise your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Take the bar out of the rack and let it rest on your fingertips. Your elbows should be all the way up throughout the movement. Step back and set your feet at shoulder width with toes turned out slightly. Squat as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">In a squat rack or cage, grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it.

Take a step or two back and stand with your feet at shoulder width and your toes turned slightly out. Take a deep breath and bend your hips back, then bend your knees to lower your body as far as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend. Drive vertically with your hips to come back up, continuing to push your knees out.</p>

Keeping your back flat, extend your hips to stand up, pulling the bar up along your legs to lockout. Here are 4 ways to break your deadlift record.</p>
