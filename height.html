              <p class="leading-relaxed">1. Stand with your feet together. Bend your knees slightly and fold your torso over your legs, moving from the hips, not the lower back.
              </br>
                2. Place your hands next to your feet or on the ground in front of you.
            </br>
                3. Inhale and extend your chest to lengthen your spine. Keep your gaze directed forward.
          </br>
                4. Exhale and gently press both legs toward straight. Lift the kneecaps and gently spiral your upper, inner thighs back. Keep your legs straight without hyperextending.
        </br>  
                5. On an exhalation, extend your torso down without rounding your back. Stay long throughout your neck, extending the crown of your head toward the ground. Draw your shoulders down your back.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed">1. Stand facing a wall and place your hands on the wall about chest high, straight out in line with your shoulders. (Tip: The top of your fingertips will be in line with the tops of your shoulders.)
              </br>
                2. Spread your fingertips and keep a slight pressure on the wall with your thumbs and index fingers.
            </br>
                3. Walk your feet back and make a ninety-degree angle with your body by placing your ankles directly beneath your hips.
          </br>
                4. Make sure your feet are pointed straight ahead (this will look slightly pigeon-toed) and your feet are hip-width distance apart (measured by a fist and a half between the ankles).
        </br>
                5. Kick your hips back and place an arch in your lower back. Allow your back to flatten and your belly to relax.
      </br>
                6. Straighten your knees and tighten your thigh muscles. Tightening the thigh muscles is a critical component and must happen for you to get the full benefit of the exercise.
    </br>
                7. Keep your elbows straight and don’t let your hands slide down the wall.
  </br>
                8. Breathe deep and hold this position for one minute.</p>

             3. Once you are lifted into the final position, straighten your legs gently.
            </br>
             4. Keep your head between your upper arms and relax your shoulders. Reach your legs long so that your heels touch the ground. If this isn’t possible, focus on lengthening your spine rather than forcing the feet to be flat on the ground.
            </br>
             5. Continue to keep your whole body engaged and focus on deep breathing</p>
