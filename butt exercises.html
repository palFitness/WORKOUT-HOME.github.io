            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart. For an added challenge, hold a dumbbell (or a water bottle or even wine bottle) in each hand at waist level, palms facing you. Keeping back flat and core engaged, bend from the hips and slowly lower hands toward the floor, keeping them close to your body, while simultaneously lifting left leg behind you. Stop when your chest is parallel to the floor. Hold for one second, then return to standing. That's 1 rep. Repeat for 10 to 12 reps, then switch legs.</p>

              <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, holding one dumbbell with both hands in front of you. Pushing knees outward, lower into a squat, keeping knees behind your feet. Squeeze your butt muscles and push through your heels to stand up, lifting arms overhead toward the right. (For an added challenge, add weights like a dumbbell or even a heavy book.) Twist your torso slightly, but keep legs and feet still. Repeat for 10 to 12 reps, then twist to the left side.</p>

Squeeze your butt muscles and push back up to standing, lifting arms overhead at the top. If you're doing this without weights, squeeze your arms as you raise them, focusing on loading power and tension into your shoulders. Hold for a few seconds at the top.

Keeping your back flat, shoulders lifted, and left leg extended, bend your right knee and lower your butt toward the ground. (Don’t let your right knee go past your right ankle.) Using your glutes, push through your heel to come back to starting position. Repeat with your left leg. Add weights as needed. Continue alternating for 10 to 12 reps on each side.</p>

Stop when your chest is parallel to floor, and return to standing. Step your right leg forward and lower your body so that your right knee is directly over your right ankle, and your left hip is directly over your left knee. Pulse twice, then squeeze your butt muscles and push up to standing. Repeat, alternating the leg you use to lunge on each rep. Do 10 to 12 reps per leg.</p>

(If you don't have a kettlebell, a jug of water will work.) Hinging at the hips, bend your knees slightly and push your butt backward, swinging the weight behind you and between your legs, slightly past your knees. Using your butt and leg muscles, push your pelvis forward and come to standing, while simultaneously swinging the weight up to shoulder level. (Your hips should do most of the work). Bring your left hand up to grab the weight. Hinge at the hips and repeat. Continue swinging for 10 to 12 reps with each hand.</p>
