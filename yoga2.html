          FORWARD FOLD
        </span>
      </div> </h1>
     <h1> <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">On your inhale, lift your arms to the sides and up, over your head.
      </br>
        On your exhale, release your arms (either in front of your body or out to the side, like a swan dive) as you fold your torso over your legs. On the first time through, have at least a slight bend in your knees. No matter how flexible you are, your hamstrings will be cold when starting out, and you’ll want to be gentle with them.
    </br>
        As you relax into the pose more, begin to straighten your legs as far as feels good. Anything that pinches or is a shooting pain should immediately stop your movement. Let gravity do the work here — don’t pull yourself down and try to force the fold.
  </br>
        You can put your hands on your shins, your feet, or the floor. This passively lengthens your spine and your hamstrings, and it’s also a great way to work on balance.

          Child’s pose  (Balasana)
        </span>
      </div></h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">In Downward-Facing Dog, take a deep breath. On the exhale, release your knees to the floor, pull your hips back to your heels, and rest your forehead on the floor.
      </br>
        You can either leave your arms stretched in front of you or pull them next to your body, hands resting palms up near your feet.
    </br>
        This is a restorative pose, so adjust it to your needs. If you want to widen your knees a bit, do so. Like all forward folds, this pose is nurturing. It relaxes your spine, shoulders, and neck, and massages your internal organs.

          Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)
        </span>
      </div> </h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">From Plank Pose, push into your hands and lift your hips up and back on the inhale. One thing that can be tricky with this pose is, again, keeping your shoulders engaged but not working too hard, and keeping a neutral spine.</br>
        Your legs should be straight, and your heels working toward the floor. There will probably be some space between your heels and the floor. You could be very flexible, but if your legs are a bit on the long side, you probably won’t have your heels all the way to the floor. That’s fine. Keep your legs active and heels reaching toward the ground.
      </br>
        Your first time in this pose, pedal out your feet a little to warm up your leg muscles.

      <h1 class="text-xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900"><div class="text-5xl font-extrabold ...">

          Garland Pose (Malasana)
        </span>
      </div> </h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Move your feet out to the edges of your mat and bend your knees, coming into a squat. The toes may turn out if necessary. If your heels do not reach the floor, you can sit on two stacked blocks. This modification makes the pose more accessible for many people.

        This is a position that is quite natural for children, but we lose the knack for it as adults. It's great for the hips and to counteract the effects of too much sitting in chairs and riding in cars.

          Mountain Pose (Tadasana)
        </span>
      </div> </h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Stand with your big toes barely touching, and your heels slightly apart. A good way to gauge your stance is to see if your second toes are parallel.
      </br>
        Press into all four corners of your feet: big toe, little toe, right side heel, left side heel. As you push into your feet, feel how that engages your entire leg and keeps those muscles active.
    </br>
        Take a deep breath and roll your shoulders up and back, releasing them down, so your shoulder blades are resting toward each other and your neck is long.
        Take a few deep breaths here. Close your eyes if you like.

        </span>
      </div></h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">From Forward Fold, put your hands flat on the floor, bending your knees as much as needed to do so. Step back one leg at a time, until you’re in a high Plank Pose.
      </br>
        Press into your hands, keep your legs parallel and engaged, and pull your bellybutton toward your spine.
    </br>
        Take a few deep breaths here, working your core and your arms.

          Raised Arms Pose (Urdhva Hastansana)
        </span>
      </div></h1>
      <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Inhale and bring your arms up and over your head. </br>Raised arms pose is your basic morning stretch, but focus on keeping the good alignment you established in mountain pose.
      </br>

        Stay grounded in the heels and keep your shoulders moving away from your ears at the same time that you reach up through your fingertips.</br> Your gaze can come up to the hands, which can be shoulder's width apart or palms touching.
